Hi, I am Ilja, I was following VR since the release of HTC Vive. I have tested every consumer VR device in the world and many business oriented devices. I have experienced numerous tracking systems, haptic gloves, movement devices, and eye tracking solutions.

I was working on several VR devices as part of [Varjo](https://varjo.com/). 

I have largest VR oriented [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/tutvr) in Russia. 

This is my blog.
