        <title>Let's talk StarVR</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;StarVR is one of the most desirable VR headsets on the market. Partially, it is because we know the team behind it managed to fit 210 degrees of horizontal FOV (Field of View) in a device that is much smaller than Pimax and XTAL headsets. But mostly, because we donâ€™t know much about it.&lt;/p&gt;
